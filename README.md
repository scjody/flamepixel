This is a work in progress.  Don't expect it to do anything useful right now.

Initial hardware is the wifire 16: https://github.com/propane-and-electrons/wifire16

A prototype of this project was shown at the [2013 Firefly Arts Festival](http://fireflyartscollective.org/) using just hello_fire and one wifire 16 board.  Unfortunately due to a flaky netbook and working in the woods (literally), the working version of the code was lost - but what's committed now is pretty close.

The current work in progress is to redesign the hardware based on experiences with the prototype before working on the software.  CAD models will be uploaded here when ready, but the timeline for this is late 2014 or early 2015.
